## **Explaining the App**

The **Video Game Recommendor** app is an interactive tool designed to provide personalized video game recommendations using the power of OpenAI's **GPT-4** model. The python file *Video_Game_Consultant* was done with **Streamlit**, this application allows users to specify their gaming preferences and receive tailored suggestions instantly. However, the app only recommends games released before **2022**, as this is the knowledge cutoff for GPT-4.

### ** For The Future **
It would be extremely interesting to update the Video_Game_Consultant code by adding a video game database with knowledge of all video games. With this addition, the app could recommend modern-day games, making it more useful. Also This project has given me many ideas of the posibilities of GPT. I could create an app like this for many things like cars, houses and even vacations.
